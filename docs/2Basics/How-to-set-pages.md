## Lets format our folders

The following is how UniLink has stored the screens that the application uses within the project folders.

![Example banner](./img/Screenshot%202023-10-11%20095901.png)

All the screens will be stored within the Screens folder.
Therfore go ahead and create a folder named Screens and add it to the project. This is how It should end up looking:

Now that the Screens folder is created lets create the following folders: Events, Splash, Groups, News.

## Time to Create all the Pages

Now that we have our folders Created we will add all the previous files. For now all the files will be created with the .js extension. Do not worry about the files with .tsx extension for now.

The end product will look like this
