UniLink has been developed by using React Native, in order to employ a new project you will have to install react native first.
```
npm install react-native
```
As well as react since react Native is built upon react
```
npm install react@18.1.0
```
Now lets create the porject. Tht following command will prompt install.
```
npx create-expo-app UniLink
```
Once installed and the project has been created, move into the folder and run the project.
```
cd UniLink
npx expo start
```

Once installed scan the QR code shown and the app should open in Expo Go on your phone.
